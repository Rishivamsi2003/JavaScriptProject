For my chosen work on creating a to-do list, I applied several essential skills, including time management, task prioritization, and user-centric design. The process began with identifying the key features that would make the to-do list both functional and user-friendly.

Firstly, I focused on time management by breaking the overall project into smaller, more manageable tasks. This helped in tracking progress and staying organized throughout the development process. I set specific deadlines for each phase, such as outlining the features, coding the front-end, and testing the application.

Secondly, I applied task prioritization by determining which features were most important to the user. The to-do list needed to be intuitive and efficient, so I prioritized tasks like adding, editing, and removing items, as well as setting deadlines and notifications. This approach ensured that the most critical features were completed first, and I could add additional functionalities, such as categories or color-coding, afterward.

I also focused on user-centric design principles, ensuring the interface was simple and easy to navigate. I considered common use cases, such as the ability to mark tasks as complete, organize them by priority, and view them based on due dates. To further improve the user experience, I incorporated features like drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering and customizable alerts for approaching deadlines.

Throughout the project, I applied problem-solving skills to address issues that arose during testing, such as compatibility with different devices or optimizing performance for faster load times. Ultimately, by combining effective time management, task prioritization, and a focus on user experience, I successfully created a functional and reliable to-do list.
